% APPLY_3D_APODIZATION Smoothly apodize tomogram to avoid sharp edges and air affecting
% the FRC analysis 
%
% [tomogram,circulo] = apply_3D_apodization(tomogram, rad_apod, axial_apod, radial_smooth)
%
% Inputs:
%     **tomogram - volume to be apodized 
%     **rad_apod - number of pixels to be zeroed from edge of the tomogram 
%     **axial_apod - roughly number of pixels to be zeroed from top / bottom 
%     **radial_smooth - smoothness of the apodization in pixels, default = Npix/10
% Outputs: 
%     ++tomogram - apodized volume 
%     ++circulo -apodization mask
